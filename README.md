Thank you Genius.com :)



TODO:
***
There is a lot of un-credited tracks so I would like to access more information somehow.

Maybe call soundcloud/last.fm API. 

Spotify has information about credits too, but I can't see that you can access that information through their API yet.
***

When no producers/writer info either:
- Don't show Written by/Produced by heading or....
- Display text like no credits/info

Send meta(?) information like alt="" for images..

Not very safe using cors?? + My token key shows.

Split up the apiURL varible..

Design

Search function

Empty search results when new search

empty search placeholder when clicking in search box

Some error message or guide in some way.

Feedback/animation to make it more obvious for user when something is happening/going on

Make artistName clickable when displating songs in searchResults

Now user can search as many times they like on the same thing

Toggle class instead of inline styling when show/display
